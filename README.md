# get_next_line

"GNL" is a project at [42 school](1) that basically reads a file line by line, read from a file descriptor.

There are so many easier methods of doing this using standar C functions, but the goal here is to be able to do it by using just our owns functions and only the standard functions *read*, 'malloc'* and *free*
